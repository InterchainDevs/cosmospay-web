# Introduction to CosmosPay
CosmosPay is a cryptocurrency plugin that enables businesses and consumers to make transactions using blockchain technology. Our innovative solution provides seamless integration with two popular content management systems, WooCommerce and PrestaShop, allowing business owners to easily accept cryptocurrencies.

### Getting Started
To begin using BitCanna Commerce, you'll need two key components:
1. **A Cosmos based Crypto Wallet** - We recommend setting up a [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/get), a secure and user-friendly digital wallet that supports our accepted cryptocurrencies.
2. **The CosmosPay Plugin** - Install the CosmosPay plugin, specifically designed for your CMS system. Currently, we support Woocommerce and Prestashop.

Our payment plugin is built on the CosmosSDK blockchain technology, ensuring a secure and efficient transaction process. With CosmosPay you can expand your payment options and tap into the growing world of cryptocurrencies.
